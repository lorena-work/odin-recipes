            <li>Add half a cup of water and pour in your milk of choice until just before the liquid rises over the dried noodles.The liquid level should be low enough that there are still dry noodles visible above the surface. Stir to combine, then set stove to medium-high heat. </li>

            <li>Continue stirring every minute until the soup starts to boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Continue stirring for approximately 2 more minutes until the noodles are completely cooked.</li>
            <li>Serve your noodles and enjoy. Eat the noodles with a soft-boiled egg for extra oomph.</li>
